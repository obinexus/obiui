# OBIUI — The Heart of Interface Design

**Adopting Inclusive and Responsive Web Design, Guided by Intention**

> “OBI” means *heart* or *soul* in Igbo — the essence of being.
> OBIUI is the soul of user interfaces: minimal, ethical, and human.

## Introduction

OBIUI is a **polyglot UI framework** focused on *intention-first design*.
It’s built on the belief that interfaces should express **clarity, dignity, and empathy**, while keeping **business logic isolated** from presentation.

Where OBI Framework defines the constitutional core, **OBIUI** builds the visible surface — the layer that touches the user’s senses.

## Philosophy

### 1. Design with Intention

OBIUI follows the **WYSIWYM** principle — *What You See Is What You Mean*.
Design should reveal meaning, not decoration. Every layout, color, and line of code reflects intent.

### 2. Minimalism as Ethics

Less is not just cleaner — it’s *truer*.
Every removed distraction restores user focus and trust.
In OBIUI:

* More design happens *in the structure*, not the surface.
* More logic happens *in services*, not the interface.

### 3. The Separation of Soul and System

* **UI Layer:** expresses feeling, interaction, and accessibility.
* **Service Layer:** handles business logic and computation.
* The two communicate through clear contracts — no entanglement, no confusion.

## Core Concepts

### 🧩 React-Like, Intention-Based

OBIUI uses familiar React-style JSX/TSX syntax, but interprets it through **intention protocols**.
It feels like React — but it’s *not React*.
It’s lighter, more declarative, and semantically aware of *why* a component exists, not just *how* it renders.

### ⚖️ Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt Mitigation (FUD Protocol)

OBIUI includes patterns to mitigate design anxiety — both for users and developers.
Interfaces are built to communicate *trust and predictability*, using transparent behaviors and ethical defaults.

### 🌍 Inclusive and Responsive by Design

* Fully accessible across sensory, cognitive, and motor contexts
* Mobile-first layouts that gracefully scale to larger screens
* Designed to *adapt to humans*, not the reverse

## Design Principles

| Principle                  | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intentional Layout**     | Every pixel has a purpose. Clarity over ornament.             |
| **Inclusive Typography**   | Readable, scalable, and neurodiversity-aware.                 |
| **Responsive Interaction** | Flows naturally across devices and input methods.             |
| **Accessible Semantics**   | Components describe their purpose to both users and machines. |
| **Ethical Color Use**      | Contrast for clarity, not manipulation.                       |

## Example

```tsx
import { OBIComponent } from '@obinexus/obiui';

export const HeartButton = OBIComponent({
  intent: 'affirmation',
  design: {
    minimal: true,
    accessible: true,
  },
  render: ({ text, onClick }) => (
    <button
      onClick={onClick}
      aria-label={text}
      data-obx-intent="affirm"
    >
      {text}
    </button>
  )
});
```

This isn’t just a button — it’s a declaration of respect between designer and user.

## Building with OBIUI

1. **Install**

   ```bash
   npm install @obinexus/obiui
   ```

2. **Create Your Interface**

   ```tsx
   import { Interface } from '@obinexus/obiui';

   export default function App() {
     return (
       <Interface
         respects="user-agency"
         honors="minimalism"
         adapts="responsively"
       >
         {/* Your heartful UI here */}
       </Interface>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Design for Meaning**

   * Start from mobile (the most human scale)
   * Define layout → typography → content → interaction
   * Let structure speak more than surface

## Vision

OBIUI exists to **restore humanity in design**.
It’s a technical and moral stance:

* Every interaction should *preserve dignity*
* Every pixel should *mean something*
* Every developer should *build with heart*
